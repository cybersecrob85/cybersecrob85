# Hi, I’m Robert Potter — The Security Wizard 🧙‍♂️🔐

I’m a U.S. Air Force veteran and hands‑on technologist moving from complex ride/show systems into cybersecurity. I blend real‑world ops discipline with blue‑team engineering: detection content, incident playbooks, secure game‑service architecture, and small automations that make defenders faster.

---

## What I’m About 

I troubleshoot systems under pressure, write clear playbooks, and automate repetitive blue‑team work. I’m currently studying for a B.S. in Cybersecurity (Full Sail University) while building a practical portfolio: detection rules (Sigma), Python/PowerShell tools, DFIR runbooks, and a secure live‑service game architecture for an indie studio. I believe in measured, documented, reproducible security — and I ship in small, reviewable commits.

## Highlights

* **Security+ (CompTIA)** and **ISC2 CC**; strong foundation across blue‑team fundamentals and governance.
* **Disney Ride/Show Systems (2019–2025):** preventive maintenance, server/audio equipment care, ticketing (Maximo), and legacy upgrades with an eye toward security.
* **Air Force Security Operations (2011–2015):** access control, vulnerability checks, incident response discipline.
* **DC407 Community:** active contributor helping newcomers find their path and stay engaged with local events.

## Core Skills

**Blue Team:** log parsing, IOC enrichment, alert triage, playbook writing, ticket hygiene.

**Detection Engineering:** Sigma rule authoring, tuning for signal/noise, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK.

**DFIR:** quick‑start investigation steps, Windows event triage, evidence handling basics.

**Secure Game Services:** server‑authoritative design, OAuth2/JWT, rate‑limiting & telemetry, secure update/patch delivery.

**Tooling:**  Zeek/Wireshark (beginner); Kali basics; Terraform (starter‑level).

## Current Projects

### 1) **Game Security — Continuum**

Design notes and checklists for a single‑player title with live services (UE 5.5 + Diversion; Xbox/Steam targets):

* Minimize client trust; server‑authoritative state
* OAuth2‑based auth flows; TLS everywhere
* Signed/encrypted content updates; version enforcement
* Rate‑limiting, anomaly telemetry, and basic anti‑tamper strategies

---

## Certifications

* CompTIA **Security+**
* ISC2 **Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)**
* Google **Cybersecurity Certificate**
* Google **IT Support Professional**

---

## Education

**Full Sail University** — A.S. Computer Science → B.S. Cybersecurity (in progress, target Aug 2027)

---

## Recent Activities & Learning

* Blue‑team practice: TryHackMe rooms, log analysis drills
* Drafting security proposals and training docs (NDA/IP awareness, secure build pipelines)
* Contributing to local cyber meetups and communities (talks, workshops, and peer mentoring)
* Volunteering At Bsides Orlando to be involved in the community. I worked the Soldering Village and as well as runner and helped with setup and teardown.
* Completed “Vulnerability Management with Nessus” On linkedin Learning.
* Completed "Intro to Splunk" From Splunk.

---

## How I Work (Principles)

* **Ship small:** frequent, reviewable commits with tests and linting
* **Document everything:** READMEs, examples, and runbooks first

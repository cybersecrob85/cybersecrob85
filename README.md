# Hi, I‚Äôm Robert Potter ‚Äî The Security Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîê

I‚Äôm a U.S. Air Force veteran and hands‚Äëon technologist moving from complex ride/show systems into cybersecurity. I blend real‚Äëworld ops discipline with blue‚Äëteam engineering: detection content, incident playbooks, secure game‚Äëservice architecture, and small automations that make defenders faster.

---

## What I‚Äôm About 

I troubleshoot systems under pressure, write clear playbooks, and automate repetitive blue‚Äëteam work. I‚Äôm currently studying for a B.S. in Cybersecurity (Full Sail University) while building a practical portfolio: detection rules (Sigma), Python/PowerShell tools, DFIR runbooks, and a secure live‚Äëservice game architecture for an indie studio. I believe in measured, documented, reproducible security ‚Äî and I ship in small, reviewable commits.

## Highlights

* **Security+ (CompTIA)** and **ISC2 CC**; strong foundation across blue‚Äëteam fundamentals and governance.
* **Disney Ride/Show Systems (2019‚Äì2025):** preventive maintenance, server/audio equipment care, ticketing (Maximo), and legacy upgrades with an eye toward security.
* **Air Force Security Operations (2011‚Äì2015):** access control, vulnerability checks, incident response discipline.
* **DC407 Community:** active contributor helping newcomers find their path and stay engaged with local events.

## Current Projects

### 1) **Game Security ‚Äî Continuum**

Design notes and checklists for a single‚Äëplayer title with live services (UE 5.5 + Diversion; Xbox/Steam targets):

* Minimize client trust; server‚Äëauthoritative state
* OAuth2‚Äëbased auth flows; TLS everywhere
* Signed/encrypted content updates; version enforcement
* Rate‚Äëlimiting, anomaly telemetry, and basic anti‚Äëtamper strategies
* Created overall security document for 25 man indy game studio. Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18t4eDCqif1f8u4wiBZw4jCeHoNYHMiqPJlo4Obiez3c/edit?usp=sharing

## Recent Activities & Learning

* Blue‚Äëteam practice: TryHackMe rooms, log analysis drills
* Drafting security proposals and training docs (NDA/IP awareness, secure build pipelines)
* Contributing to local cyber meetups and communities (talks, workshops, and peer mentoring)
* Volunteering At Bsides Orlando to be involved in the community. I worked the Soldering Village and as well as runner and helped with setup and teardown.
* Completed ‚ÄúVulnerability Management with Nessus‚Äù On linkedin Learning.
* Completed "Intro to Splunk" From Splunk.

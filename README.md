# Hi, I’m Robert Potter — The Security Wizard 🧙‍♂️🔐

I’m a U.S. Air Force veteran and hands‑on technologist moving from complex ride/show systems into cybersecurity. I blend real‑world ops discipline with blue‑team engineering: detection content, incident playbooks, secure game‑service architecture, and small automations that make defenders faster.

---

## What I’m About 

I troubleshoot systems under pressure, write clear playbooks, and automate repetitive blue‑team work. I’m currently studying for a B.S. in Cybersecurity (Full Sail University) while building a practical portfolio: detection rules (Sigma), Python/PowerShell tools, DFIR runbooks, and a secure live‑service game architecture for an indie studio. I believe in measured, documented, reproducible security — and I ship in small, reviewable commits.

## Highlights

* **Security+ (CompTIA)**,**Network+ (CompTIA)** and **ISC2 CC**; strong foundation across blue‑team fundamentals and governance.
* **Disney Ride/Show Systems (2019–2025):** preventive maintenance, server/audio equipment care, ticketing (Maximo), and legacy upgrades with an eye toward security.
* **Air Force Security Operations (2011–2015):** access control, vulnerability checks, incident response discipline.
* **DC407 Community:** active contributor helping newcomers find their path and stay engaged with local events.
* **Interviews** Interviewed on the Bowtiesecurityguy's Podcast. you can fine the interview here: https://lnkd.in/eiN8t9yT

## Current Projects

### 1) **Game Security — Continuum**

Design notes and checklists for a single‑player title with live services (UE 5.5 + Diversion; Xbox/Steam targets):

* Minimize client trust; server‑authoritative state
* OAuth2‑based auth flows; TLS everywhere
* Signed/encrypted content updates; version enforcement
* Rate‑limiting, anomaly telemetry, and basic anti‑tamper strategies
* Created overall security document for 25 man indy game studio. Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18t4eDCqif1f8u4wiBZw4jCeHoNYHMiqPJlo4Obiez3c/edit?usp=sharing

### 2) Project and Portfolio I
Understand the essential functions of operating systems, application software, hardware, networking, and security practices
Plan a small-scale information technology solution.
Construct a simulation of the proposed solution.
Revise their project plan based on research and troubleshooting.
Identify continuing education and certification offerings within the information technology industry.
